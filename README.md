jdk1.4-vagrant-box
==================

This is a box that is ment for trying out Java Development Kit 1.4.

I created it to test the differences between the two memory models.

Download a "*linux-i586.bin" from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase14-419411.html#j2sdk-1.4.2_30-sol-JPR) and place it to "shared" folder, then rename it to "jdk4.bin".
After that execute "vagrant up". 

Now you have a Vagrant box running with JDK1.4 installed.

Dependencies
==================
You must have the following installed:
* Vagrant
* Virtualbox
